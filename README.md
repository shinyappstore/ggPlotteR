# ggPlotteR: Encode Data Visualizations Line by Line

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/ggPlotteR](https://shinyappstore.com/a/ggPlotteR)__

ggPlotteR is an educational application designed to demonstrate the step-by-step and line-by-line use of the ggplot2 package for data visualization in R. It allows users to generate plots and retrieve the R-code for recreating them. The app's code is partially based on ggplotGUI by Gert Stulp, and it incorporates the concept of line-by-line encoding from Evangeline Reynolds. ggPlotteR offers an intuitive interface and the option to download the generated graph in PNG format. The application includes a built-in dataset for setting up plot inputs, eliminating the need for users to upload their datasets. However, it also allows users to upload their datasets if desired, offering flexibility in data handling.
